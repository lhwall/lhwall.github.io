I love puzzles!  I love crossword puzzles and jigsaw puzzles and logic puzzles.  I like editing and proofreading.  I used to work as a passport examiner and I liked putting together the pieces of an application to figure out their status and how they fit within the law.  I am excited moving into coding as a career because it allows me to build things and put disparate elements together to see how they work.  My early forays into JavaScript have been a delight!  What a thrill to approach a problem with the tools you need (including Google) and plug away until you have solved it.  I love stretching my brain and am thrilled to be moving into a field where there is always more to learn.
