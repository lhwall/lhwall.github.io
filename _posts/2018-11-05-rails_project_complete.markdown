I finished my rails project!  It's a modification of my Sinatra project with a few new methods (e.g. sorting upcoming events in chronological order, something that would be very helpful for a real-world application).  

Rails has a very steep learning curve; I picture it like a logarithmic graph where it gets easier once you master the basics but initially it is very, very difficult.  It took me a long time to conceptualize Rails and, while I understand how all of the helpers are actually helpful, it's so much more abstract than regular Ruby that it took me some time to get used to it; I wanted to use links instead of link_tos and forms instead of form_fors.  Once I got used to it, I definitely do see how Rails is extremely helpful, and it's streamlined, but it isn't as intuitive.  I hated it at first and now I don't hate it, but it made me feel more distant from my code.  I'm excited to start on Javascript which I think will click a little better for me than Ruby did initially.  

With that said, Rails is definitely more plug-and-play than basic Ruby.  Once you set up a few routes and controllers so much of it happens automatically, but it also means it's super finicky.  You don't have much choice in terms of how you name things, &c.  I think that's largely good, especially if you're working as part of a team, because it demands standardization, but it can be frustrating.  In short, Rails took a lot of getting used to for me, I absolutely see the utility and you can do a lot really fast in Rails which is great, but it takes a while to get there.
